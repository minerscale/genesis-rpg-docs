Hello there!

Welcome! You've stumbled upon some project project to make an RPG for the Sega Genesis! Not much is known about this project other than that the person who is making it has a horrible track record when it comes to sticking to plans. So don't get excited. But hey! I made the Github Repo, started work on the blog for the game so I might not get horribly sidetracked so I might actually finish this one.

Anywho I'll be using [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK)   (Sega Genesis Development Kit) or more specifically [Gendev](https://github.com/kubilus1/gendev) because assembler is cancer. SGDK is a small toolchain for developing games in C for the Sega Genesis and Gendev is a tool for setting it up on Linux. I don't know how this is going to pan out but with the scale of the project I expect it to take *I dunno, two years?* at a minimum with me just chipping away at it as a hobby (A bit like Cave Story I guess). Mabye I could make some dough off this. Who knows!

I'm gonna do what my Design and Tech teacher told me and I'll use the design process! (Crazy huh?) ooh! look at this diagram! Isn't it nice and descriptive of what I'll be doing or something?

I wanna make it so if this was a D&T project I would get an a-plus-erooni! {% include apluserooni.html %}
